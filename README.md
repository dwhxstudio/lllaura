## What is a studio?

A studio for me is a multifaceted kind of place. Maybe because of how the meaning of this word changes across languages, maybe because of past experiences. I first knew the studio, as a place of work or related to commerce which had a cheaper rent because there was no kitchen. Some people in the art scene of the city where renting studios to live because it was an available option and very well located, in the hearth of the city. Nowadays a studio, in the sense of real state, means an apartment, a flat. I had once a shared a studio that was a rented house (which was named ateliê-studio-casa, in english: atelier-studio-house) with two other artists. The name was because we saw it as a place to live too. It was a place for workshops, events, photo sessions, study, art practice, meetings.
My idea of studio also changed with my practice and vice-versa. I started making an effort to do drawings and installations very portable, in modules. And when I started working more with technology, it felt as if the set computer-table-chair was my studio. I used frequently free platforms like flickr, facebook, etc. But for me, the problem with using platforms that belong to this type of corporations is, in one example, my lost of the key to enter the account when I moved from one continent to the other (for my own security, as the website informed). Therefore, for my own security, I’m locked outside of it. Nowadays flickr has more aggressive advertisement practice which pops up ads every once in a while when you look at a sequence of pictures, and as with other platforms of the same style, the space for the ads appears to grow more and more as times passes.

I see studio as a place which is very flexible and that should be flexible in favour of your practice. A dynamic place, for ideas to be discussed, to happen, to be cooked and fermented. A place for reflection, pauses and exhibitions.
Because of this, I think it's always interesting to have present in an online studio some links or images to references, be it artistic, symbolic or theoretical.
