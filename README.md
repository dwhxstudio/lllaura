What is a studio?
A studio for me is a multifaceted kind of place. Maybe because of how the meaning of this word changes across languages, maybe because of my past experiences. In Brazil, some years ago, a studio, was meant to be a place of work or related to commerce and the rent was cheaper because there was no kitchen. Some people in the art scene of the city where renting studios to live because it was an available option and very well located, in the hearth of the city. Nowadays a studio means an apartment, a flat. I had once a shared a studio that was a rented house (which we called ateliê-studio-casa*, in english atelier-studio-house) with two other artists. The name was because the artist occupying the place before me actually lived in the place besides using the studio and, on my turn, i also lived there a somehow, sleeping there some days of the week because my house was really far away. It was a place for workshops, events, photo sessions, study, art practice.
My idea of studio also changed with my practice and vice-versa. I started making an effort to do drawings and installations very portable, in modules. And when I started working more with technology, if felt as if the set computer-table-chair was my studio. I used frequently free platforms like flickr, facebook, etc. But eventually lost the key to enter the account when I moved from one continent to the other ( for your own security, as the website informed). Therefore, to my own security, I’m locked outside of it, and nowadays flickr has more aggressive and cheesy advertisement which pops up every once in a while when you look at a sequence of pictures...

I see studio as a place which is very flexible and that should be flexible in favour of your practice. A dynamic and effervescent place, a place for ideas to be discussed, to happen, to be cooked and fermented. A place for reflection, pauses and exhibitions.
